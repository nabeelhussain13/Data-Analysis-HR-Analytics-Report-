# HR Analytics Report: Data Analysis Project

## Overview
The **HR Analytics Report** is a data analysis project designed to provide insights into employee attendance, work-from-home trends, and sick leave patterns. The project was conducted using Power BI and Excel, leveraging DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for advanced calculations.

## Project Steps
The project was completed in four key steps:

### 1. Understanding the HR Requirements
- Identified key insights required by the HR team, including:
  - Employee attendance insights
  - Work-from-home employee insights
  - Sick leave insights

### 2. Data Gathering & Transformation
- **Challenge:** The initial Excel data was unstructured with dates in separate columns.
- **Solution:** Developed a general template for future data integration, ensuring structured data for easy analysis.
- **Outcome:** Simplified data processing for future updates.

### 3. Creating DAX Measures
- Developed key DAX measures to enhance the report's analytical capabilities:
  - Percentage of total employee attendance
  - Work-from-home percentage
  - Sick leave percentage
- These measures provided actionable insights for HR decision-making.

### 4. Creating the Power BI Report
- Created a dynamic Power BI report incorporating all HR requirements.
- Integrated interactive visuals to effectively communicate insights.

## Key Insights & Findings
- The analysis highlighted specific trends in employee attendance, work-from-home practices, and sick leave patterns.
- Provided HR with data-driven insights to optimize workforce management.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and report creation.
- **Excel**: For data gathering and initial data transformation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For creating advanced calculations and measures.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Data Format Issues:** The raw data was not structured for easy analysis. A standardized template was created to streamline data integration and transformation.
- **Insight Generation:** Developed custom DAX measures to generate meaningful insights from the data.

## Acknowledgements
